// TODO: I Dunno, takes away the fun / gamble
When creating a potion, or a salve the rules are a bit different: When rolling to create a potion and you fail, checkout if you have enough successes to make a salve of the same type. If you do so you created a salve instead of a potion, if you still haven’t enough successes you check if you have enough to make an ointment. If you fail to make an ointment, you fail and your Laboritory level drops by one.

## Survival
Survival is rolled to find food in the wild, or to rest up in dangerous places. Before you roll you must decide, to roll Survival to Camp, or to Find food and water. If you are with a group, you could decide to split up tasks. For either one you need to roll the difficulties below using the rules for rolling an Obstruction.
- diffyculty 1 = Surviving in a village, town or city. Basically going though others garbage.
- difficulty 2 = Surviving in a natural environment like forrests and plains.
- difficulty 3 = Surviving in a hars environment like a mountain, taiga, caverns and dungeons.
- difficulty 4 = Surviving dangerous environments like hot deserts, snowy tundra & deadly jungles.
- difficulty 5 = Surviving the extreme, snow storms, sand storms and polar climates.

When failing any of these, you fail your stakes. If you fail any of these by 2 or more successes, you get and extra Infliction Hungry & Thirsty. 

**Camping**: If you succeed a Camp roll you find a save place to rest undesturbed. If you do so all partymembers in the same Scene may Cure the Infliction Exhaustion.

**Find food & water**: If you succeed a Find food & water roll you find a number of Rations equal to the number of successes you rolled above the difficulty. For example if you rolled 4 successes when in a forrest (difficulty 2) you get 2 rations. If you did not roll above the difficulty but equal to the difficult, you (the one that rolls to find food and water, and any party member helping on your roll) may choose heal the Hungry & Thirsty Infliction.

If you use survival in a village, town or city, your presents in that place becomes unwanted. After doing this once you get a disadvantage roll to all Downtime actions in that village until you pay off 2 coins. If you do this twice, you get a disadvantage and a efficiency penalty to all Downtime actions until you pay off 3 coins to that specific place. If you do this three or more times the local guard or sherrif will immediatly drive you out of town. From now on you are not welcome in that specific place until you pay off 5 coins. Paying off doen not reduce the number of times you used Survival in a specific place. The coins you pay off represent you doing something back for the community, after all you are begging for food and scavenging through other peoples garbage.

**Buying**
- difficulty 1 = get an item with a total value of 1 coin for free when buying items for a total price of 10 coins or higher.
- difficulty 2 = get an item with a total value of 1 coin for free when buying items for a total price of 8 coins or higher.
- difficulty 3 = pay 1 coin less or get an item with a total value of 2 coins for free when buying items for a total price of 6 coins or higher.
