## Brew
The Brewing Skill can be used to create concoctions, see the concoctions list in the items section. To brew one of these you tell the group which one of these you are going to make if you have the appropriate ingredients. The difficulty of the item you want to make is equal to the amount of coin the item costs. If you succeed, you created the item to said you where going to make, if you fail you didn’t. In any of these cases the ingredients you used are gone.

When creating a potion, or a salve the rules are a bit different: When rolling to create a potion and you fail, checkout if you have enough successes to make a salve of the same type. If you do so you created a salve instead of a potion, if you still haven’t enough successes you check if you have enough to make an ointment. If you fail to make an ointment, you just fail.
