# The basics of the game
The main objective of the game is reaching `Goals`. These goals give you as a group a reason to tell stories together, and give the characters you play a reason to go out and explore the world. The character you as a player play, must complete `Personal goals` in order to progress. For completing `Personal goals` you earn `Assets`. As a party you as a group must complete `Party goals` this also leads to personal progression, and expansion of the narative. successfully completing `Party goals` improve your character's `Attributes`. 

Party goals come from problems that live in the world around you, after all you are a group of heroic adventures. `Personal goals` are the things you character want's from this world, and therefore create interactions. Before starting the game you first create the world around you, and from what lives in this world you can set `Party goals`, see chapter: `World Building`. After you created the world, you need a party. A party consists of characters, which are played by all the players around the table. These characters are created together, see the chapter: `Character Creation`

## Start of the game
You can start the game after you created a new world, see chapter: `World Building`, and every player has a character, see chapter: `Character Creation`.

This is your first session. At the start of every session you play, every player must decide what the goal for their character is going to be. Discuss as a group what your `Personal goal`s are going to be, help eachother out in this process and let other players know what your `Personal goal` is going to be. A personal goal must always be linked to an Asset, the section [Personal goals](#Personal) below describes how link these goals to Assets, how you complete these goals, and what you get when you do so.

If all `Personal goals` are set, determine who will start the game (just pick, or roll dice if necessary), and play out everyone's turns clockwise. The first player in turn may tell the group what action she is going to take, after she completed her action, she gives the turn to the next player.

## Playing your turn
During your turn you pick what action your character is going to take from the list below:
1. Travel to another `Place`.
2. Progress your `Personal goal`.
3. Progress the `Party goal`.
4. Prepare.
5. Downtime.

---
## Travel to another `Place`.
You may Travel to another place, this may be an existing place, or this may be new place of your choice. In order to go to an existing place you roll a `Test of Skill` Travel and check the result, in the `Testable Skills` secetion. If you wand to go to a non-existing place (meaning you haven't wrote this place down in the places list on the `World Sheet`) you create one using the Test of Skill Navigate, in the `Testable Skills` section.

If you leave, you ask which of your party members are going to join you. If you go alone, or others decide to stay, the group is separated. Characters that stay behind get an extra turn, before you arrive at you new detination. If for some reason you get stuck, during your travels. People that stayed behind mey try to find you, roll a `Test of Skill` Hunt, whith a predetermind difficulty: the difficulty of the Travel or Navigate the lost person rolled plus one. While Traveling or Hunting, if you still had an extra turn from others Traveling or Hunting, you lose that extra turn.

## Progress your `Personal goal`
Your personal goal is always about personal gain. There are three different catagories of stuff to gain in this game, called Assets. These three categories are: 
1. Items (the stuff your character carries)
2. Relations (friend and family your character has)
3. Resources (groups and orginazations you join or locations you own)

>### Items
>You can try to earn a special item, tell the group what the name of this item is, and why it is special. Also tell the group what obstacle is in the way of getting the item. The group may tell you how difficult this obstacle is, but the more difficult, the better the item is going to get. The base difficulty of an Item is equal to the cost of a corresponding item in the general items list. Extra difficulty added by players mean an extra bonus die, when using the item. If you fail, the item still exists but is in the hands of someone else.

>### Relations
>You can choose to improve an existing relationship you have or to create new relationships. 

>If you want to improve an existing relationship you could choose to help this person out, or to buy this person items. The difficulty for increasing an existing relation is equal to the relations level plus one. When you succeed you may add 1 point to the level of the relation upto a maximum of 3 levels. when you fail, drop the level the relationship by one. If a relation has dropped lower than one, this person becomes an enemy of you. 

>If you want to create a new relationship, let the group know the name, what kind of person and how you approach this person. The difficulty of creating a new relation depends on the relations influence, if you succeed you write down the relation at level 1. If you roll twice the relations influence, your relationship starts at level 2, and if you roll three times the relations influence your relation starts at level 3. If you fail, you create an enemy or antagonist! A relationship level cannot become higher than level 3.

>### Resources 
>You can choose to improve an existing group or organization, or create a new one. You can also choose to improve an existing location or create a new location. A location is a specific Scene that belongs to you. For instance the class Alchemist starts with a Laberatorium. This Laberatorion is a Scene that extists in a Place of your choice.

>The rules for improving or creating groups and organizations work exactly the same as the rules for Relations.

>The rules for improving or creating a new location also work the same as the rules for Resources, but with the following differences:
>- when improving, if you fail the loction you owned is destroyed, you still own it, but it is in ruins.
>- when creating a new location and you fail, you still create the location, but it is owned by someone else.

Roleplay what happens and roll to Overcome the specific Obstruction roll using the predetermined Skill and difficulty. See the chapter Overcome, on how to overcome an Obstruction.

<!--TODO: Party goals-->
## Progress the `Party goal`
The world you created has `Current problems` and `Impending problems`. When you choose to progress the party goal, you must choose a scene within place you are in now, and make a plan. You may decide which of the other characters are in this scene, and together with the other characters you start planning. Only characters that are in the same Place and are not Taken-out, are allowed to join.

>**Phase 1: Set a Goal**
>
> Because you choose to progress, your character is the one that called all party member together, because your character beliefs something must be done about your current situation. Tell the others what problem your charcater sees in the future and what you feel the party should do. All the characters that have joined, must agree on pursuing the action. If someone does not agree with the proposed goal, that character may give the group a slightly different version of the goal. If there is still a dispute about the specifics, all characters are starting an Escaltion level 1 Conflic in the form af a Debate. See rules on overcoming Obstacles. 

<!--TODO: Setting dangers and positive outcomes-->

When you have decided on a dangers, you immediately go to the `Phase: Make a plan` below. 


>**Phase 2: Make a Plan**
>
>All the players at the table decide together, how acchieveble or difficult this goal is going to be. The more difficult you as a group set this goal, the more obstacles you are going to have to overcome, but also the bigger the reward. 
>Pick a difficulty: 
>   - Easy = 2 Obsacles (level 1)
>   - Moderate = 3 Obstacles (level 2)
>   - Hard = 4 Ostacles (level 3)
>   - Expert = 5 Obstacles (level 4)
>
>There are 6 different type of obstacles your plan can exist of:
>   - Hunt (track down a person or creature)
>   - Investigate (find clue's about a what happend in the past)
>   - Study (Gather useful or even nessesary infomation)
>   - Travel (travel to another Place)
>   - Explore (explore Scenes within a place)
>   - Face Enemies (face an existing or new enemy)
>
>You may pick a number of obstacle types equal to the difficulty you set. You may pick every obstacle type only once. To overcome these Obstacles you roll a Test of Skill except for Face Enemies. 
>
>For Face Enemies you pick one of the parties enemies from the `World Sheet` with a influence level that comes closest to the difficulty set:
>   - Easy difficulty: relationship level of 1.
>   - Moderate difficulty: relationship level of 2.
>   - Hard diffculty: relationship level of 3.
>   - Exert difficulty: relationship level of 4.
>   - Extra, if you don't have any enemies, or you as a group feel you need a new one: create a new enemy or monster and set its relationship level at 2 and discuss the as a group how strong this creature is. If its a weak enemy, set its Influence to 1. If its a moderate enemy use 2, or strong enemy use 3. For dragons, experts and powerful enemies use an influence of 4.
>
>When you as a group have finished deciding on the obstacle types, you place them in the order they sould be completed in. After this the turn of the player starting the Progress the `Party goal` ends.

>**Phase 3: Execute**
>If a player decides to continue to Progress the `Party goal`, that player must pick the first obstacle in line and complete it by rolling either a Test of Skill or a Conflict depending on the obstacle type. If all obstacles are completed, you have finished the 'Patry Goal' and you and all other players that have written down this goal may remove it from you character sheet and add 5 points to your Attribute's divided any way you like.
> 
>Player characters that do not have the goal set yet, can choose to play a scene in which they talk to the others, and get it later on. These player should be in the same place as one of the players that allready has the goal.
>
>If all players are Taken-out you are Game Over. There are no actions to take from here.
>
>If all player have Given-in you have automatically fleed the place you are in, and are in a different place.

## Prepare
You may choose to prepare to one of the earlier named actions: 
1. Travel to another `Place`.
2. Progress your `Personal goal`.
3. Progress the `Party goal`.

If you choose to do so, tell the group how you are going to acchieve this, and roleplay this out. Preparing is always an Obstacle with a difficulty of 2. 
- When you are successful, anyone may choose to get an advantage if that character uses the created preperation when overcoming the action you prepared for. 
- If you failed, anyone trying to overcome the action you prepared for gets a disadvantage. 

This advantage or disadvantage only counts once. After the action is rolled the advantage or disadvantage dissapates.
