# The basics of the game
The main objective of the game is reaching `Goals`. These goals give you as a group a reason to tell stories together, and give the characters you play a reason to go out and explore the world. The character you as a player play, must complete `Personal goals` in order to progress. For completing `Personal goals` you earn `Assets`. As a party you as a group must complete `Party goals` this also leads to personal progression, and expansion of the narative. successfully completing `Party goals` improve your character's `Attributes`. 

Party goals come form problems that live in the world around you, after all you are a group of heroic adventures. `Personal goals` are the things you character want's from this world, and therefore create interactions. Before starting the game you first create the world around you, and from what lives in this world you can set `Party goals`, see chapter: `World Building`. After you created the world, you need a party. A party consists of characters, that are roleplayed, by all the player around the table. These characters are created together, see the chapter: `Character Creation`

## Start of the game
You can start the game after you created a new world, see chapter: `World Building`, and every player has a character, see chapter: `Character Creation`.

This is your first session. At the start of every session you play, every player must decide what the goal for their character is going to be. Discuss with the rest of the group what your `Personal goal` is going to be, and help eachother out in this process. The section [Personal goals](#Personal) below describes how you complete these goals, and what you get when you do so.

If all `Personal goals` are set, determine who will start the game (just pick, or roll dice if necessary), and play out everyone's turns clockwise. ~~The party (all of the characters) starts in one of the locations you set at `World Building`, decide as a group which one of these locations it is going to be.~~ The first player in turn may tell the group what action she is going to take, after she completed her action, she gives the turn to the next player.

## Playing your turn
During you turn you pick what action your character is going to take from the list below:
1. Travel to another `Place`.
2. Progress your `Personal goal`.
3. Progress the `Party goal`.
4. Prepare.
5. Downtime.

## Travel to another `Place`.
You may Travel to another place, this may be an existing place, or this may be new place of your choice. In order to go to an existing place you roll a `Test of Skill` Travel and check the result, in the `Testable Skills` secetion. If you wand to go to a non-existing place (meaning you haven't wrote this place down in the places list on the `World Sheet`) you create one using the Test of Skill Navigate, in the `Testable Skills` section.

If you leave, you ask which of your party members are going to join you. If you go alone, or others decide to stay, the group is separated. Characters that stay behind get an extra turn, before you arrive at you new detination. If for some reason you get stuck, during your travels. People that stayed behind mey try to find you, roll a `Test of Skill` Hunt, whith a predetermind difficulty: the difficulty of the Travel or Navigate the lost person rolled plus one. While Traveling or Hunting, if you still had an extra turn from others Traveling or Hunting, you lose that extra turn.

## Progress your `Personal goal`
Your personal goal is always about personal gain. There are three different catagories of stuff to gain in this game, called Assets. These three categories are: 
1. Items (the stuff your character carries)
2. Relations (friend and family of your character)
3. Resources (the groups you join, and locations you own)

1. You can try to earn a special item, tell the group what the name of this item is, and why it is special. Also tell the group what obstacle is in the way of getting the item. The group may tell you how difficult this obstacle is, but the more difficult, the better the item is going to get. The base difficulty is equal to the cost of a corresponding item in the general items list. Extra difficulty added by players mean an extra bonus die, when using the item. If you fail, the item still exists but is in the hands of someone else.

2. You can choose to improve an existing relationship you have or to create new relationships. If you want to improve an existing relationship you could choose to help this person out, or to buy this person items. The difficulty for increasing an existing relation is equal to the relations level plus one. If you want to create a new relationship, let the group know the name, what kind of person and how you approach this person. The difficulty of creating a new relation is 2, if you win you write down the relation at level 1. If you roll 4 successes, your relationship starts at level 2, and if you roll 6 successes your relation starts at level 3. If you fail, you create an enemy or antagonist!

Roleplay what happens and Overcome an Obstruction roll using the predetermined Skill and difficulty. See the chapter Overcome, on how to overcome an Obstruction.
