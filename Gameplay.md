What this game is about:
- Roleplaying characters, making hard choices and taking heroic actions.
- Telling stories together.

These are the tools in play:
- **`Goals`**: When a `Goal` is reached the characters `Attributes` improve. To complete `Goals` players must overcome `Obstacles`. `Obstacles` represent the hard choices and give players the chance to let there characters be heroic.

- **`Fate points`**: When players roleplay their characters they get `Fate points`. `Fate points` can be used to improve die roles when overcoming `Obstacles`.

- **`Aspects`**: These are the characters high-concept, personality and beliefs. `Aspects` tell us what our chacrater is good at in the form of `Aspects` and `Skills`, how she behaves, and how reacts to specific situations. If the player roleplay their charcaters well the earn `Fate points`.

- **`Attributes`**: `Attributes` represent the things characters are naturally good at. `Skills` effectivity are based on `Attributes`.

- **`Skills`**: `Skills` represent the things characters have learned or are trained at. Players use `Skills` to overcome `Obstacles`. `Skills` improve when you roll them successfully, this means that `Fate points` are important to improve `Skills`.

- **`Assets`**: These represent the Items, Relations and Resources the characters have. All the things a character would live for. `Assets` can help out in specific situations to overcome `Obstacles` even better. But these, like in movies, are also the things that are at stake when overcoming `Obstacles`.

- **`Inflictions`**: This rerpesents the characters mental and physical health. And just like Assets this is at stake when overcoming `Obstacles`. Unlike `Assets`, `Inflictions` give penealties to die rolls, but can also heal again but taking `Downtime`, and roleplaying.

- **`Downtime`**: A moment for the players and their characters to do as they like, and heal up. During `Downtime`, Mental `Infliction` can be healed by having fun, Physical `Infliction` can be healed by resting and eating. `Downtime` is also used to Obtain and maintain `Assets`, and to prepare for the comming quests.
