# Overcoming obstacles

## When do I roll
If the obstacle it too easy, you automatically succeed or, if the obstacle is too hard you automatic fail.
If a roll is too complex it either automatically fails or you could choose to split it up. For example, if i would say: “i sneak in the castle and kill the king”, the GM could state that that is too complex unless you split the task up. If then i would say: “Okay, i will try to sneak up first”, the GM could say: “fine but it is going to be a hard task”. This means that you could split a task up into multiple smaller tasks, to make them more realistic, and therefore increase the chance that things could go sideways.

## Types of obstacles
There are 3 types of obstacles:
>### Test of skill
>In a test of skill the outcome differs by the number of successes you roll. Look at the Skill Test list to see which skill can be rolled as a test and what the outcome are if you do so. The upside of a Test of skill is that no matter the roll there is always an outcome, the downside is you can NOT give in, and you may only improve the skill your using if you roll higher then the level of that skill.

> ### Obstruction 
>The difficulty is fixed, and set the GM. Example difficulties are:
>- Easy = difficulty 1
>- Moderate = difficulty 2
>- Hard = difficulty 3
>- Expert = difficulty 4

>### Conflict 
>In a conflict the obstacle is an entity that actively opposes you (for example if an enemy tries to stop, harm, convince or distract you). The difficulty of a conflict is measured by an opposed overcome roll by the opposition. The player character or the opposing entity who is resolving her turn is called the Aggressor. This means that if it’s the GMs turn, the opposition could try to overcome a player character, or if it is a players turn, that players character could try to overcome the opposition.

When the GM presents an obstacle, he lets you know what type of obstacle it is. If its a Test of skill, you don’t need to know the difficulty, the result is checked after you roll. If it is a Obstruction, the GM tells you the difficulty before rolling. If it is a Conflict the GM and the player roll simultaneously, the one with the highest outcome wins.

## Determine the outcome
The outcome of a Test of skill is determined by the specific skill you roll for. 

When rolling for an Obstruction make sure to determine what the specific obstacle is and will happens if the roller succeeds. This means start a short discussion as a group what a reasonable outcome is. Once the outcome is clear, the GM give it the agreed upon difficulty (as explained in the When do I roll part) after which it can not be changed in any way . This means that the GM has to keep the promised outcome without presenting the same Skill rerolls. 

The outcome of a Conflict is a bit different, first you have to determine what the Escalation level is by determining what you are trying to achieve. Every participant within the situation has to keep his actions within the scope of the Escalation level. The same as determining an Obstruction the outcome is determined at forehand, but in this case by the Aggressor. So if it is the GM’s turn, the GM tells the Group what the outcome is (what the opposition is aiming for). And if it’s the players turn, the player that is acting out her turn, tells the Group what result she wants. So, for instance the GM could tell the party: “The large hungry dragon will eat the Knight alive!” (the dragon example will result in Taken-out). If the GM wins his dice roll, that statement will become reality. If the Aggressor states the outcome it must be within the scope of the Escalation level.

### Escalation levels & outcome:
| Level | Description | Oucome |
| :-: | --- | --- |
| 1 | Convince, Confront, Deflect or Avert | Opposition agrees or is a averted. |
| 2 | Challenge, Intimidate or Drive-Off | Opposition obeys or flee’s. |
| 3 | Force or Aggress | Opposition is captivated or forced to do your bidding. |
| 4 | Assault, Harm or Destroy | Opposition is Taken-out. |

## Set the Stakes
There is always something is at stake if you lose the outcome of your roll. The things that can be at stake are: Mental- or Physical Stress, or an Item, Relation or Resource. 
The stakes are automatically set to the type of Attribute used to roll a Skill or Wise. If the Attribute is of the Physical type the Stake will be Physical Stress, and for a Mental attribute you use Mental Stress.

You may bargain for something else to be at stake. Tell everyone how an Item, Relation or Resource you own con be at stake in this situation. The GM must agree, and it must be convincing within the narrative. For instance, a Relation cannot suddenly spawn itself, but you could say, “because i’m always in danger, my wife worries too much, and will leave me”.

>**Note**: If you have already marked-off the inflictions related to the Skill roll, you have to bargain for something else. If you cannot bargain for something else in this situation, you automaticly fail your roll!

## Gather your dice
Tell everyone how you want to overcome the obstacle at hand, and pick an appropriate Skill or Wise. 
- Take one six sided die and start a dice roll pool. 
- Take a number of 6 sided dice equal to the Skill- or Wises bonus from your Fate point pool and add them in the separate dice roll pool.
- Add an extra die to your dice roll pool if you approach the situation in the manner of the Approach Aspect you picked.
- If you have a clear Advantage on which everyone agrees, or you gained an Advantage as a bonus, you may add an extra die to the dice roll pool. You can only get one die from having an Advantage. Some example advantages are:    
    - Armed vs unarmed in an Escalation level of 2 or higher.
    - Sneaking in a dark surrounding.
    - Intimidating an obviously smaller group.
- If you have an Item, Relation, Resource that is appropriate to this situation you may add their bonuses to the dice roll pool.

## Rolling the dice
### Count successes on a roll
First of all, look at the efficiency of the Attribute that is linked to the Skill you are using (most Skills have multiple Attributes linked, in this case you may take the highest, but it also define the way you use this skill narratively). If you are rolling a Wise the Attribute is always Insightful. The efficiency determines when you roll a success. An efficiency of +6 means that you roll a success if you roll a 6, An efficiency of +5 means that you roll a success if you roll a 5 or higher etc.

### Receiving Help from others
Party members that haven't got a turn yet (after the last turn of the GM) may offer to help out, this is done before you rolled your dice. Helping out also means that the party member that does so loses her next turn. If you get help from a party member, that party member rolls separately. While rolling to overcome you may add the number of successes of the helping party member to your successes minus one (yes, this means if a helping party member rolls zero successes, you get a penalty of one success). Helping party members gather dice as described in the Gather your dice section and may use Fate points and Stakes to raise their results. A helping party member that tries to protect or assist also suffers from any negative outcome determined above, unless he or she uses a Wise and helps out from the sideline.

### Giving-in
Before rolling your dice, and after you know the difficulty, instead of rolling you may choose to Give-in. In a Conflict you may even ask GM to roll first and look at the outcome. If you Give-in you automatically lose your roll, and you may not Escalate on your next turn. If you Give-in though you do get a skill point as if you have won and, if you are in a Conflict, you are removed from the scene.

## Determine the outcome
Roll the dice you collected and count the number of successes you have:

- **Test of skill**:
Checkout the specific task you test and lookup it’s results.

- **Obstruction**:
To overcome an Obstruction you need a number of successes equal to the Obstructions difficulty. If you do so, you succeeded your roll.

- **Conflict**:
If you are resolving a Conflict you need more successes than the opposition to succeed your roll.  In case of a tie both contenders fail their roll, the outcome (see Determine the outcome) does not become true and nobody earns any Skill points because everyone failed their rolls. You lose a Conflict if the opposition is the Aggressor and succeeds their overcome roll. You win a Conflict if you are the Aggressor and you succeed your overcome roll.

### Succeeding your roll
If the outcome is successful you get what you agreed upon in the section Determine the outcome. You also may add 1 point to the Skill or Wise you used to overcome an Obstruction or Conflict obstacle. Earning points for rolling a Test of skill works a little different. If you rolled a Test of skill you check the current level of the Skill you used, if you have equal or more successes on your roll you may add 1 point to that Skill.
### Failing your roll
First the stake you set becomes a reality, if you agreed on taking stress you take stress equal to the Shift of the outcome (the number of successes you lost with). If you’ve put an Item, Relation or Resource on the line, drop the level of your Item, Relation or Resource by the Shift of the outcome. If it reaches zero the Item, Relation or Resource is lost, broken or gone. 

After determining the outcome you could accept your fate and move on to the next player's turn. 

**Raise the Stakes**: If you don’t like the outcome you can raise the stakes, this means that you put something new at stake, and reroll all of your dice.

## Taking Stress
If you take Stress you mark off inflictions. There are two kinds of inflictions, Mental Inflictions and Physical Inflictions. If you take Mental Stress, you mark the next infliction box starting with the Dazed infliction box. If you already marked Dazed you mark the Confused Infliction box etc. The same works for Physical Stress, you start by marking off the Hungry & thirsty Infliction box, and continue as shown in the Table below:

### Mental Stress
>**Dazed**
>- Effect: Roll all Mental based Obstacles with a Disadvantage.
>- Cure: When not Confused, Dazed is cured by resting
>
>If already marked, Dazed is followed by Confused.

>**Confused**
>- Effect: Roll all Mental based Obstacles with an -1 Efficiency penalty.
>- Cure: When not in Shock, Confused is cured by a full days rest.
>
>If already marked, Confused is followed by Shock.

>**Shock**
>- Effect: Subtract one success when rolling Mental Based Obstacles.
>- Cure: Shock is cured during Downtime.

### Physical Stress
>**Hungry & thirsty**
>- Effect: Roll all Physical based Obstacles with a Disadvantage.
>- Cure: When not Exhausted, Hungry & Thirsty is cured by eating and drinking..
>
>If already marked, Hungry & thirsty is followed by Exhausted..

>|**Exhausted**|
>- Effect: Roll all Physical based Obstacles with an -1 Efficiency penalty.
>- Cure: When not Wounded, Exhausted is cured by a full days rest.
>
>If already marked, Confused is followed by Shock.

>**Wounded**
>- Effect: Subtract one success when rolling Physical Based Obstacles.
>- Cure: Wounded is cured during Downtime.

**Note**: Efficiency cannot become lower than level zero, which is equal to +6.

## Escalating and Calming
**Escalating**: If you still don’t like the outcome, you may choose the take the Conflict to the next level by escalating. This can only be done on your next turn by declaring that you are going to Escalate. The opposition, played by the GM, may also choose to Escalate.

**Calming**: During your turn you may also try to calm the situation. If you have an appropriate skill you may set the outcome to calm the situation during the Determine the outcome phase. If you succeed your roll the Escalation level is one lower than before. The Escalation level cannot become lower than one, you have to come to some sort of agreement. Some penalties may apply when trying the calm the situation, see the table below.
### Penalties for Calming
|Situation|Penalty|
|-|-|
|If you do not speak the same language|-1 Efficiency to your roll|
|If you face an enemy that is aggressive by nature|+1 Bonus die for the opposition|
Helping party members receive the same penalties.

## Taken-out
When you fail defending in a Conflict of Escalation level 4, you are Taken-out. If your Taken-out, your character is unconscious and she can’t act on your turn anymore. If you are Taken-out and the party leaves you with the opposition, the GM decides what happens to you (most likely linked to the narrative, for instance hungry monsters will eat you!), which can lead to the death of your character. If the party manages to save you, you will become conscious after your character has received proper care, and a good night's rest.

## Quick Overview
1. **Determine Type**: When you face an obstacle, determine the type of the obstacle: 
    - Test of skill (test with predetermined outcomes)
    - Obstruction (a passive obstacle with a fixed difficulty)
    - Conflict (an active obstacle that rolls against you)
2. **Determine the outcome**: Tell the group what you are aiming for. The results of a test of skill are predetermined.
3. **Set the Stakes**: tell the group what’s at stake. Either Stress or an Asset.
4. **Gather dice**:
    - Add the dice of the skill or Wise you are using
    - Add one bonus die if you are using your Approach
    - Add or Subtract a die if you have a clear advantage or disadvantage.
    - Add bonuses from one Asset that can help you during this roll.
    - Add dice from helping party members.
5. **Rolling**: Roll the dice using the efficiency of the Attribute linked to your skill or wise you are using.
6. **Determine the outcome**:
    - Lookup a test of skill.
    - Obstructions are successful if you roll a number of successes equal or higher than it’s difficulty.
    - Conflicts are won when the Aggressor rolls more successes than her opposition.
7. **Succeeding**: if you overcome an obstacle you get what you determined before, plus you may add 1 point to the skill or wise u used. If you roll a test of skill you get a point when you rolled equal or higher than that skill or wise.
8. **Failing**: 
Take stress or drop an Assets level, whatever you agreed upon, equal to the Shift of the roll. 
If you don’t accept your fate: Use Fate points to gain extra dice or Raise the stakes to reroll the dice you rolled.
Escalating or Calming: if you lost, on your next turn, you may escalate, raising the escalation level. You may also try to calm a situation as part of the determine the outcome, which lowers the escalation level.
Taken-out: if you lose a Conflict with an Escalation level of 4 you are Taken-out.
