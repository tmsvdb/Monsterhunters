## Relations & Resources
### Relations
You can choose to improve an existing relationship you have or to create new relationships. Roleplay what happens and Overcome an Obstruction roll using the predetermined Skill and difficulty. See the chapter Overcome, on how to overcome an Obstruction.

If you want to improve an existing relationship you could choose to help this person out, give this person Resources or to buy this person Items, the GM will have to agree, before rolling. The difficulty for increasing an existing relation is equal to the relations current level plus the relations influence. When you succeed you may add 1 point to the level of the relation upto a maximum of 3 levels. when you fail, drop the level the relationship by one. If a relation has dropped lower than one, this person becomes an enemy of you. 

If you want to create a new relationship, let the group know the name, what kind of person and how you approach this person. The difficulty of creating a new relation is equal to the relations influence, if you succeed you write down the relation at level 1. If you roll twice the relations influence, your relationship starts at level 2, and if you roll three times the relations influence your relation starts at level 3. If you fail, you create an enemy or antagonist! A relationship level cannot become more than 3.

> The influence level of a Relation is equal to how wel practiced this person is in a particular skill. Or how much Resources, or how high of a Resources this person owns. Write this down next to the Relations name. Examples are:
>- A king has an influence of 5 because he owns the Resource Royalty at influence level 5. You may use this relation only if the royaly resource can help you out.
>- A trained Hunter With a tracking dog has an influence of 3 bacause he owns the Hunting Skill at level 2 and a Resource Tracking dog with a influence of 1. You may use this relation if you need help Tracking.
>- An average Baker that owns a Resource Kitchen has an influence of 2 because he owns the Cooking Skill at level 1 and a Kitchen with an influence of 1.
>- A purposeless dweller, or a begger dosn't own any Skills or Resources and therefore has an influence level of 0.

### Resources 
You can choose to improve an existing group or organization, or create a new one. You can also choose to improve an existing location or create a new location. A location is a specific Scene that belongs to you. For instance the class Alchemist starts with a Laberatorium. This Laberatorion is a Scene that extists in a Place of your choice.

The rules for improving or creating groups and organizations work exactly the same as the rules for Relations.

The rules for improving or creating a new location also work the same as the rules for Relations, but with the following differences:
- when improving, if you fail the loction you owned is destroyed, you still own it, but it is in ruins.
- when creating a new location and you fail, you still create the location, but it is owned by someone else.

Roleplay what happens and roll to Overcome the specific Obstruction roll using the predetermined Skill and difficulty. See the chapter Overcome, on how to overcome an Obstruction.

> The influence level of a Resource is based on the Resources size and participants or workers. How far stretches the influence of a persons status or group, or how large is a locations.
>
> First of status and groups: 
>- If the influence stretches over a place the influence is 1. If the influence stretches over a kingdom, region or terratory the influence is 2. If the influence stretches over a continent the influence is 3 etc.
>- If a group or organization owns Resources themselfs add the level influence of these Resources.
>- If a group or organization has a few (about 5-10) participants, the influence increases by one. If they have an average amount (about 50) of participants the influence inceases by 2. If they have a lot of participants (about 100) the influence increases by 3 etc.
>
> Second locations:
>- A location that has the size of one scene has an influence of 1. If it's a place the influence is 2. A kingdom, region or terratory has an influence of 3. If it is a continent it has an influence of 4 etc.
>- If a location has a few (about 5-10) workers or servants, the influence increases by one. If the locations  has an average amount (about 50) of workers or servants the influence inceases by 2. If the location has a lot of workers (about 100) the influence increases by 3 etc.
