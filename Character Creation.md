# Guide to character creation
Character creation is a group effort, because you want to create your characters in the same world with the same party goals and in the same spirit. You get a feel of the party and you can mix and match the skills and attributes of the different party members. Together you go on adventure, and write the story around your characters, this starts at character creation.

## About
Your character needs a name and a description so we know how to call your character an how your character looks. You donâ€™t need to make this up immediately, you can fill them in as you go. As long as you keep these in mind during character creation.  

---
## Goals
The most important element of the game are goals. Goals are what drives your character to action. You have 2 different goal types, a personal goal and a party goal. A personal goal is something your character wants to achieve or a obstacle your character needs to overcome. A party goal is goal you set as a party after you get your first mission from the GM. You may set a party goal the way you want, you could choose for instance to sabotage the mission,  as long as every party member agrees.

>If you complete a personal or party goal you may add 1 point to an attribute or a skill. The attribute must have something to do with the Personal Goal you set for your character.

For now you can leave your goals blank, but at the start of every session, you need to make up your goals right after the GM did his intro.

---
## Attributes
These are properties of your character in which she is naturally good at. The higher an attribute, the better the outcome of related skill roll. Attributes have points that represent a level, the more points you have in an attribute the higher your attributes level.

>### You start with: 
>- 2 attributes of your choice at 5 points.
>- 2 attributes of your choice at 10 points.
>- 2 attributes of your choice at 15 points.
>- 2 attributes of your choice at 20 points.
>- 1 attribute of your choice at 25 points.
>- 1 attribute of your choice at 30 points.

>### For every attribute that is:
>- below 10 write down an efficiency of 6+
>- equal or above 10 points, write down 5+
>- equal or above 30 points, write down 4+
>- equal to 60 points, write down 3+

An attribute cannot have more than 60 points.

## Skills
Skill are the things your character is trained at. To overcome an obstacle in the game you need to roll one of these skills to test if you succeed. The better you are at a skill the more dice you get to roll. Skills have points that represent a level, the more points you have in an skill the higher your skills level.

>### You start with: 
>- 3 skills of your choice at 5 points.
>- 2 skills of your choice at 10 points.
>- 1 skill of your choice at 15 points.

>### For every skill that is:
>- below 10 write down a dice bonus of 0
>- equal or above 10 points, write down a dice bonus of 1
>- equal or above 30 points, write down a dice bonus of 2

## Wises
Wises are the same as skills, except in that they are not fixed (so you can make them up) and they are always linked to the Insightful Attribute. Wises can be used to help other players when rolling to overcome, or when you roll to gain insight. Wises cannot be used to replace skills (this means Haggle wise will not replace the Haggle Skill). 

>You start with 1 wise of your choice, and write it down as: [your knowledge or experience]+wise.

**Examples are:**
 - Naturewise
 - Streetwise
 - Politics wise
 - Religion wise
 - Noblewise

## Aspects
Aspects tell us about your characters personality, behaviour and motivations. When an aspect brings you or your party in trouble, you get fate points. When you need extra dice on a roll you may spent fate points and tell everyone how these aspect can help you out in that specific situation. 

A>spects can also be invoked by the GM, other players or yourself (if you are in need of more fate points). When an aspect gets invoked, that aspect brings you or your party immediately in trouble. The person invoking your aspect must explain how, and you may add a fate point to your character sheet. 

There a 5 aspects that define your character:
- **Class**: represents your characters high concept.
